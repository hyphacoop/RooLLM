The policy aims to provide financial stability and flexibility during this significant life event.\n\n### Key Points of the Policy:\n\n1. **Eligibility**: All Hypha members are eligible for parental leave, regardless of their gender or role in the child's life (e.g., birth parent, adoptive parent, or partner).\n\n2. **Leave Duration**: Members can take up to 30 weeks of paid parental leave. This leave can be taken all at once or spread out over a longer period, depending on the member's preference and work arrangements.\n\n3. **Pay During Leave**: During the leave, members will receive their full pay for the first 15 weeks. For any additional weeks taken (up to the maximum of 30 weeks), members will receive 67% of their regular pay.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Leave Duration**: If a member wishes to extend their leave beyond 30 weeks, they can do so by taking unpaid leave. This extension must be agreed upon with their team and should consider the project's needs and deadlines.\n\n5. **Notification Requirements**: Members are asked to notify Hypha of their intention to take parental leave as soon as possible. This notification helps in planning work redistribution and ensuring a smooth transition during the memberâ€™s absence.\n\n6. **Returning to Work**: Upon returning from leave, members have the right to return to their previous role or an equivalent position if their original role has been filled or changed. Hypha is committed to supporting members in reintegrating into work life after their leave.\n\n7. **Support for Parents**: In addition to financial support, Hypha offers resources and guidance on balancing work and parenting responsibilities. This includes access to counseling services, flexible working hours, and the option to work part-time during the transition back to full-time work."
