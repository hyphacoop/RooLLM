Binary numbers have historical roots in multiple cultures but were formally studied by Thomas Harriot and Gottfried Leibniz in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nFor example, the binary number 11001 corresponds to the decimal number 25. Any decimal number from 0 to 255 can be represented using an 8-bit binary number."
