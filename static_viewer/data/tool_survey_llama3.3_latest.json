The binary system operates in \"base 2\" using digits 0-1 to represent numbers, whereas the decimal system operates in \"base 10\" using digits 0-9. \n\nA single binary digit (like \"0\" or \"1\") is called a \"bit\" - short for binary digit. The word binary comes from \"Bi-\" meaning two. Each digit of a binary number counts a power of 2, with place values being powers of 2 (e.g., 2‚Å∞, 2¬π, 2¬≤). \n\nFor example, the decimal number 2024 equals 11111101000 in binary. This can be verified as: 1√ó2‚Åπ + 1√ó2‚Å∏ + 1√ó2‚Å∑ + 1√ó2‚Å∂ + 1√ó2‚Åµ + 1√ó2‚Å¥ + 0√ó2¬≥ + 1√ó2¬≤ + 0√ó2¬π + 0√ó2‚Å∞ = 2024. \n\nBinary numbers have various applications, including computer programming, data storage, and digital communication. They are used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices because of their direct implementation in electronic circuits using logic gates."
